Don't make me read your mind 
You should know me better than that 
It takes me too much time 
You should know me better than that 
You're not that much like me 
You should know me better than that 
We have different enemies 
You should know me better than that 
I should leave it alone but you're not right 
I should leave it alone but you're not right 

Can't you write it on a wall 
You should know me better than that 
There's no room to write it all 
You should know me better than that 
Can you turn the TV down 
You should know me better than that 
There's too much crying in the sound 
I should know you better than that 
I should leave it alone but you're not right 
I should leave it alone but you're not right 

I should live in salt for leaving you behind 
Behind 

Think about something so much 
You should know me better than that 
Start to slide out of touch 
You should know me better than that 
Tell yourself your it's all you know 
You should know me better than that 
Learn to appreciate the void 
You should know me better than that 

I should live in salt for leaving you behind 
Behind 
I should live in salt for leaving you behind 
Behind 

I should live in salt for leaving you behind 
Behind






When I think of you in the city,
The sight of you among the sites.
I get this sudden sinking feeling,
Of a man about to fly.
Never kept me up before,
Now I’ve been awake for days.
I can’t fight it anymore,
I’m going through an awkward phase.
I am secretly in love with,
Everyone that I grew up with.
Do my crying underwater,
I can’t get down any farther.
All my drowning friends can see,
Now there is no running from it.
It’s become the crux of me,
I wish that I could rise above it.

But I stay down,
With my demons.
But I stay down,
With my demons

Passing buzzards in the sky,
Alligators in the sewers.
I don’t even wonder why,
Hide among the under views.
Huddle with them all night long,
The worried talk to god goes on.
I sincerely tried to love it,
Wish that I could rise above it.

But I stay down,
With my demons.
I stay down,
With my demons
I stay down,
With my demons.
I stay down,
With my demons
I stay down,
With my demons

Can I stay here? I can sleep
on the floor
paint the blood and hang the palms,
On the door.
Do not think I’m going places anymore,
Wanna see the sun come up above New York.
Oh, everyday I start so great,
Then the sunlight dips.
Less I’ve learned,
The more I see the pythons and the limbs.
Do not know what’s wrong with me,
Sours in the cup.
When I walk into a room,
I do not light it up.
Fuck.

So I stay down,
With my demons
I stay down,
With my demons
I stay down,
With my demons
I stay down,
With my demons






Gold light breaks behind the houses
I don't see what's strange about this
Tiny bubbles hang above me
It's a sign that someone loves me

I can hardly stand up right
I hit my head upon the light
I have faith but don't believe it
It's not there enough to leave it

Everything I love is on the table
Everything I love is out to sea

I have only two emotions
Careful fear and dead devotion
I can't get the balance right
With all my marbles in the fight

I see all the ones I went for
All the things I had it in for
I won't cry until I hear
Cause I was not supposed to be here

Everything I love is on the table
Everything I love is out to sea
I'm not alone
I'll never be
And to the bone
I'm evergreen

I'm tired I'm freezing I'm dumb
When it gets so late I forget everyone
I need somewhere to stay
Don't think anybody I know is awake

Calm down, it's alright
Keep my arms the rest of the night
When they ask what do I see
I say a bright white beautiful heaven hanging over me

I'm not alone
I'll never be
And to the bone
I'm evergreen
And if you want (dead seriously)
To see me cry (don't swallow the cap)
Play Let It Be (pat yourself on the back)
Or Nevermind (dead seriously)

Is it time to leave? Is it time to think about
What I want to say to the girls at the door?
I need somewhere to be
But I can't get around the river in front of me

Calm down, it's alright
Leave my arms the rest of the night
When they ask what do I see
I say a bright white beautiful heaven hanging over me

I'm not alone (dead seriously)
I'll never be (don't swallow the cap)
And to the bone (pat yourself on the back)
I'm evergreen (dead seriously)
And if you want (dead seriously)
To see me cry (don't swallow the cap)
Play Let It Be (pat yourself on the back)
Or Nevermind (dead seriously)






You keep a lot of secrets
And I keep none
Wish I could go back
And keep some

You're fireproof
Nothing breaks your heart
You're fireproof
It's just the way you are

You tell me you're waiting
To find someone
Who isn't so hopeless
There's no one

You're fireproof
Nothing breaks your heart
You're fireproof
How'd you get so far?

You're a needle in the hay
You're the water at the door
You're a million miles away
It doesn't matter anymore

Jennifer, you are not the only reason
My head is boiling and my hands are freezing
Jennifer, you are not the only one
To sit awake until the wild feelings leave you

You're fireproof
Nothing breaks your heart
You're fireproof
It's just the way you are

You're fireproof
It's what you always say
You're fireproof
Wish I was that way






Oh you say you love me, Joe
How am I supposed to know?
When you go under the waves
What am I supposed to say?

I see people on the floor
They slide into the sea
Can't stay here anymore
We're turning into fiends

If I stay here
Trouble will find me
If I stay here
I'll never leave

If I stay here
Trouble will find me
I believe

Joe, I'll always think of you
As the kind of child who knew
This was never gonna last
Joe, you fell so fast

Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you but
They say love is a virtue, don't they?
Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you but
They say love is a virtue, don't they?

Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you but
They say love is a virtue, don't they?
Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you but
They say love is a virtue, don't they?

I see people on the floor
They slide into the sea
Can't stay here anymore
We're turning into fiends

I see you rushing down
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing down
What did Harvard teach you?

I see you rushing down
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing down
What did Harvard teach you?

I see you rushing down [(don't drag me in)]
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing down [(don't drag me in)]
What did Harvard teach you?

I see you rushing down [(don't drag me in)]
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing down [(don't drag me in)]
What did Harvard teach you?






I could walk out, but I won't
In my mind I am in your arms
I wish someone'd take my place
Can't face heaven all heavenfaced

No one's careful all the time
If you lose me I'm gonna die

How completely high was I?
I was off by a thousand miles
Hit the ceiling, then you fall
Things are tougher than we are

I could walk out, but I won't
In my mind I am in your arms
I wish someone'd take my place
Can't face heaven all heavenfaced

Let's go wait out in the fields with the ones we love
Let's go wait out in the fields with the ones we love
Let's go wait out in the fields with the ones we love
Let's go wait out in the fields with the ones we love

She's a griever, I believe her
It's not a fever, it's a freezer
I believe her, I'm a griever now

She's a griever, I believe her
It's not a fever, it's a freezer
I believe her, I'm a griever now

Because we’ll all arrive
In heaven alive
We’ll all arrive
Because we’ll all arrive
In heaven alive
We’ll all arrive






Oh, when I lift you up you feel
Like a hundred times yourself
I wish everybody knew
What's so great about you
Oh, but your love is such a swamp
You don't think before you jump
And I said I wouldn't get sucked in
Ah
Oh, don't tell anyone I'm here
I got Tylenol and beer
I was thinking that you'd call
Somebody closer to you
Oh, but your love is such a swamp
You're the only thing I want
And I said I wouldn't cry about it
Ah
We were so under the brine
We were so vacant and kind
We were so under the brine
We were so vacant
We were so under the brine
We were so vacant and kind
We were so under the brine
We were so vacant
Oh, when I lift you up you feel
Like a hundred times yourself
I wish everybody knew
What's so great about you
Oh, but your love is such a swamp
You don't think before you jump
And I said I wouldn't get sucked in
Ah
I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waiting anymore
I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waiting anymore
I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waiting anymore
Jenny I am in trouble
Can't get these thoughts out of me
Jenny I'm seeing double
I know this changes everything
Jenny I am in trouble
Can't get these thoughts out of me
Jenny I'm seeing double
(It takes a lot of rain in the cup)
I know this changes everything
(It takes a lot of pain to pick me up)
(It takes a lot of rain in the cup)
(It takes a lot of pain to pick me up)
Baby you gave me bad ideas
Baby you left me sad and high






No one will answer your prayers
Until you take off that dress
No one will hear all your crying
Until you take your last breath

But you will learn
To mind me
And you will learn
To survive me

No one will answer your prayers
Until you take off that dress
No one will hear all your crying
Until you take your last breath

But you will learn
To mind me
And you will learn
To survive me

Your father before you
And your sister too
Your husband and blah blah blah blah
You






Graceless
Is there a powder to erase this?
Is it dissolvable and tasteless?
You can't imagine how I hate this
Graceless

I'm trying, but I'm graceless
I don't have the sunny side to face this
I am invisible and weightless
You can't imagine how I hate this
Graceless

I'm trying, but I'm gone
Through the glass again
Just come and find me
God loves everybody

Don't remind me
I took the medicine and I went missing
Just let me hear your voice
Just let me listen

Graceless
I figured out how to be faithless
But it would be a shame to waste this
You can't imagine how I hate this
Graceless

I'm trying, but I'm gone
Through the glass again
Just come and find me
God loves everybody

Don't remind me
I took the medicine and I went missing
Just let me hear your voice
Just let me listen

All of my thoughts of you
Bullets through rotten fruit
Come apart at the seams
Now I know what dying means

I am not my rosy self
Left my roses on my shelf
Take the white ones they're my favorites
It's the side effects that save us
Grace

Put the flowers you find in a vase
If you're dead in the mind it'll brighten the place
Don't let 'em die on the vine, it's a waste
Grace

There's a science to walking through windows
There's a science to walking through windows
There's a science to walking through windows
There's a science to walking through windows without you

All of my thoughts of you
Bullets through rotten fruit
Come apart at the seams
Now I know what dying means

I am not my rosy self
Left my roses on my shelf
Take the white ones they're my favorites
It's the side effects that save us
Grace

Put the flowers you find in a vase
If you're dead in the mind it'll brighten the place
Don't let them die on the vine, it's a waste
Grace

Grace
Put the flowers you find in a vase
If you're dead in the mind it'll brighten the place
Don't let them die on the vine, it's a waste
Grace






I'm in the city you hated
My eyes are falling
Counting the clicks with the living dead
My eyes are red

I'm in the crush and I hate it
My eyes are falling
I'm having trouble inside my skin
I try to keep my skeletons in

Is it weird to be back in the south?
And can they even tell
That the city girl was ever there
Or anywhere

I'm having trouble inside my skin
I try to keep my skeletons in
I'll be your friend
And a f*ck up and everything,
But I'll never be
Anything you ever want me to be.

I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts out
I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts out

I don't need any help to be breakable, believe me
I know nobody else who can laugh along to any kind of joke
I won't need any help to be lonely when you leave me

It'll be easy to cover
Gather my skeletons far inside
It'll be summer in Dallas
Before I realize

I don't want you to grieve
But I want you to sympathize (alright)
I can't blame you for losing
Your mind for a little while (so did I)
I don't want you to change
But I want you to recognize (that I)

It'll be easy to cover
Gather your skeletons far inside
It'll be summer in Dallas
Before you realize
That I'll never be
Anything you ever want me to be

I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts out
I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts out






I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I need my girl

Remember when you lost your shit and
Drove the car into the garden
And you got out and said I'm sorry
To the vines and no one saw it
I need my girl
I need my girl

I'm under the gun again
I know I was the 45 percenter then
I know I was a lot of things
But I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I need my girl

There's some things that I should never
Laugh about in front of family
I'll try to call you from the party
It's full of punks and cannonballers
I need my girl
I need my girl

I'm under the gun again
I know I was the 45% percenter then
I know I was a lot of things
But I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I keep feeling smaller and smaller






I survived the dinner
And the air went thinner
I retired to the briars by the pool
It gets so loud

If I die this instant
Taken from a distance
They would probably list it down
Among other things 'round town

Got my rings around me
I got baby to pound me
I see stars and go weak
My baby cries and lays me down

In the skies over black Venice
I see eyes of a white menace
The surprise of the week
Is that I never heard the sound

All the L.A. women
Fall asleep while swimmin'
I got paid to fish 'em out
And then one day I lost the job

And I cried a little
I got fried a little
Then she laid her eyes on mine
And she said, "Babe, you're better off"

I got my rings around me
I got baby to pound me
I see stars and go weak
My baby cries and lays me down

In the skies over black Venice
I see eyes of a white menace
The surprise of the week
Is that I never heard the sound

Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave my little life today

As the free-fall advances
I'm the moron who dances
Ah
I was teething on roses
I was in guns and noses
Ah

Under the withering white skies of humiliation
Under the withering white skies of humiliation

Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave a little life today
Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave a little life today

She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it
She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it
She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it






I couldn't find quiet
I went out in the rain
I was just soakin' my head to unrattle my brain
Somebody said you disappeared in a crowd
I didn't understand then
I don't understand now

Am I the one you think about 
When you're sitting in your faintin' chair drinking Pink Rabbits?
Am I the one you think about 
When you're sitting in your faintin' chair drinking Pink Rabbits?

And everybody was gone 
You were staring down the street 'cause you were tryin' not to crack up
It wasn't like a rain, it was more like a sea
I didn't ask for this pain, it just came over me
I love a storm, but I don't love lightning
All the waters coming up so fast, it's frightening

Am I the one you think about 
When you're Sitting in your faintin' chair drinking Pink Rabbits?
Am I the one you think about 
When you're sitting in your faintin' chair drinking Pink Rabbits?

And everybody was gone
I was staring down the street 'cause I was trying not to crack

I was solid gold
I was in the fight
I was coming back 
From what seemed like a ruin
I couldn't see 
You coming so far
I just turn around 
And there you are

I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
I was just getting used to living life without you around
I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
You always said I held you way too high off the ground

You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in the park
You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart
You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in a park
You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart

And everybody was gone
You were staring down the street cause you were trying not to crack up
Bona Drag was still on
Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sound kicks out
Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sound kicks out

You said it would be painless
A needle in the dark
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all
You said it would be painless
A needle in the dark
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all (when the sound kicks out)

You said it would be painless
The needle in the dark (when the sound kicks out)
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all






I can see the glowing lights
I can see them every night
Really not that far away
I could be there in a day

I wonder if you live there still
I kinda think you always will
If I tried you'd probably be
Hard to find

What I feel now about you then
I'm just glad I can't explain
You're beautiful and close and young
In those ways we were the same

There's a lot I've not forgotten
I let go of other things
If I tried they'd probably be
Hard to find

They can all
Just kiss off into the air
They can all
Just kiss off into the air

I don't know why we had to lose
The ones who took so little space
We're still waiting for the ease
To cover what we can't erase

I'm not holding out for you
I'm still watching for the signs
If I tried you'd probably be
Hard to find

They can all
Just kiss off into the air
They can all
Just kiss off into the air






It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in

Its quiet company
Its quiet company

It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in

Its quiet company
Its quiet company
Its quiet company

And I can't fall asleep
Without a little help
It takes a while to settle down my shivered bones
Until the panic's out

It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break

company
It's quiet company
It's quiet company
It's quiet company

And I won't follow you
Into the rabbit hole
I said I would, but then I saw your shivered bones
They didn't want me to

It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in
It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders
It's a terrible love and I'm walking in

It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break
It takes an ocean not to break






Sorrow found me when I was young
Sorrow waited, sorrow won
Sorrow, they put me on the pill
It's in my honey, it's in my milk

Don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water
Cover me in rag and bone sympathy
'Cause I don't wanna get over you
I don't wanna get over you

Sorrow's my body on the waves
Sorrow's a girl inside my cake
I live in a city sorrow built
It's in my honey, it's in my milk

Don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water
Cover me in rag and bone sympathy
'Cause I don't wanna get over you
I don't wanna get over you

Don't leave my hyper heart alone on the water
Cover me in rag and bone sympathy
'Cause I don't wanna get over you
I don't wanna get over you






Say you stayed home
Alone with the flu
Find out from friends
That wasn't true

Go out at night
With your headphones on again
And walk through
The Manhattan valleys of the dead

Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost
Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost

But I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else

You said I came close
As anyone's come
To live underwater
For more than a month

You said it was not inside my heart, it was
You said it should tear a kid apart, it does

Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost
Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost

But I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else
I don't want anybody else

I had a hole in the middle
Where the lightning went through it
Told my friends not to worry
I had a hole in the middle
Someone's sideshow wouldn't do it
I told my friends not to worry

Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost
Didn't want to be your ghost
Didn't want to be anyone's ghost






Little faith, follow me
I set a fire in a blackberry field
Make us laugh or nothing will
I set a fire just to see what it kills

Now, I'm stuck in New York
And the rain's coming down
I don't feel like we'll go anywhere
Stuck in New York
And the rain's coming down
Still in line for the Vanity Fair

Leave our red southern souls
Head for the coast
Leave our red southern souls
Everything goes

All our lonely kicks
Are getting harder to find
We'll play nuns versus priests

All our lonely kicks
That make us saintly and thin
We'll play nuns versus priests

Awesome prince, get your sleep
Lose your pas history
Make us laugh or nothing will
I set a fire just to see what it kills

Don't be bitter, Anna
I know how you think
You're waiting for Radio City to sink
You'll find commiseration in everyone's eyes
The storm will suck the pretty girls into the sky

All our lonely kicks
Are getting harder to find
We'll play nuns versus priests

All our lonely kicks
That make us saintly and thin
We'll play nuns versus priests

Leave our red southern souls
Head for the coast
Leave our red southern souls
Everything goes






Venom radio and venom television
I'm afraid of everyone, I'm afraid of everyone
They're the young blue bodies with the old red bodies
I'm afraid of everyone, I'm afraid of everyone

With my kid on my shoulders, I'll try
Not to hurt anybody I like
But I don't have the drugs to sort
I don't have the drugs to sort it out, sort it out

I defend my family with my orange umbrella
I'm afraid of everyone, I'm afraid of everyone
With my shining new star-spangled tennis shoes on
I'm afraid of everyone, I'm afraid of everyone

With my kid on my shoulders, I'll try
Not to hurt anybody I like
But I don't have the drugs to sort
I don't have the drugs to sort it out, sort it out

But I don't have the drugs to sort
I don't have the drugs to sort it out, sort it out

Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul

Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul
Your voice is swallowing my soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul, soul






Stand up straight at the foot of your love
I lift my shirt up
Stand up straight at the foot of your love
I lift my shirt up

I was carried to Ohio in a swarm of bees
I never married but Ohio don't remember me

Lay my head on the hood of your car
I take it too far
Lay my head on the hood of your car
I take it too far

I still owe money to the money, to the money I owe
I never thought about love when I thought about home
I still owe money to the money, to the money I owe
The floors are falling out from everybody I know

I'm on a blood buzz, yes, I am
I'm on a blood buzz
I'm on a blood buzz, God, I am
I'm on a blood buzz

I was carried to Ohio in a swarm of bees
I never married but Ohio don't remember me

I still owe money to the money, to the money I owe
I never thought about love when I thought about home
I still owe money to the money, to the money I owe
The floors are falling out from everybody I know

I'm on a blood buzz, yes, I am
I'm on a blood buzz
I'm on a blood buzz, God, I am
I'm on a blood buzz






So happy I was invited
Give me a reason to get out of the city
See you inside watching swarms on TV
Livin' or dyin' in New York it means nothing to me
I gave my heart to the Army
The only sentimental thing I could think of
With cousins and colors and somewhere overseas
But it'll take a better war to kill a college man like me
I'm too tired to drive anyway, anyway right now
Do you care if I stayed?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find somethin' on this thing that means nothin' enough
Losin' my breath
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld, I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld, I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
This pricey stuff makes me dizzy
I guess I've always been a delicate man
Takes me a day to remember a day
I didn't mean to let it get so far out of hand
I was a comfortable kid
But I don't think about it much anymore
Lay me on the table, put flowers in my mouth
And we can say that we invented a summer lovin' torture party
I'm too tired to drive anyway, anyway right now
Do you care if I stayed?
You can put on your bathing suits
And I'll try to find something on this thing that means nothin' enough
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld, I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld, I want to sit in and die
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld
Losin' my breath







There's no saving anything
Now we're swallowing the shine of the sun
There's no saving anything
How we swallow the sun

But I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway

What makes you think I'm enjoying
Being led to the flood?
We've got another thing coming undone
And it's taking us over

We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead, throw your arms in the air tonight
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead, lose our shirts in the fire tonight

What makes you think I'm enjoying
Being led to the flood?
We got another thing coming undone

But I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway

What makes you think I'm enjoying
Being led to the flood?
We've got another thing coming undone
And it's taking us over

We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead, throw your arms in the air tonight
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead, lose our shirts in the fire tonight

But what makes you think I'm enjoying
Being led to the flood?
We got another thing coming undone
We got another thing coming undone
And it's taking forever

I'll go braving everything
With you swallowing the shine of the sun
I'll go braving everything
Through the shine of the sun

But I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway
'Cause I won't run
No, I won't be no runaway

What makes you think I'm enjoying
Being led to the flood?
We've got another thing coming undone
And it's taking us over

We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead, throw your arms in the air tonight
We don't bleed when we don't fight
Go ahead, go ahead, lose our shirts in the fire tonight

What makes you think I'm enjoying
Being led to the flood?
We got another thing coming undone
We got another thing coming undone
And it's taking forever






I think the kids are in trouble
Do not know what all the troubles are for
Give them ice for their fevers
You're the only thing I ever want anymore

Live on coffee and flowers
Try not to wonder what the weather will be
I figured out what we're missing
I tell you miserable things after you are asleep

Now we'll leave the silver city 'cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the silver city 'cause all the silver girls
Everything means everything

It's a Hollywood summer
You'd never believe the shitty thoughts I think
Meet our friends out for dinner
When I said what I said, I didn't mean anything

We belong in a movie
Try to hold it together 'til our friends are gone
We should swim in a fountain
Do not want to disappoint anyone

Now we'll leave the silver city 'cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the silver city to all the silver girls
Everything means everything

I was afraid, I'd eat your brains
I was afraid, I'd eat your brains
'Cause I'm evil
'Cause I'm evil

I'm a confident liar
Had my head in the oven so you'd know where I'll be
I'll try to be more romantic
I wanna believe in everything you believe

I was less than amazing
Do not know what all the troubles are for
Fall asleep in your branches
You're the only thing I ever want anymore

Now we'll leave the silver city 'cause all the silver girls
Gave us black dreams
Leave the silver city to all the silver girls
Everything means everything

I was afraid, I'd eat your brains
I was afraid, I'd eat your brains
'Cause I'm evil
'Cause I'm evil
'Cause I'm evil






Can someone send a runner
Through the weather that I'm under
For the feeling that I lost today?

You must be somewhere in London
You must be loving your life in the rain
You must be somewhere in London
Walking Abbey Lane

I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make corrections

Famous angels never come through England
England gets the ones you never need
I'm in a Los Angeles Cathedral
Minor singing airheads sing for me

You put an ocean and a river between everybody and us
Between everything, yourself and home
You put an ocean and a river
Between everything, yourself and home

You must be somewhere in London
You must be loving your life in the rain
You must be somewhere in London
Walking Abbey Lane

Vanderlyle, crybaby, cry
Oh, the waters are rising
Still no surprising you
Vanderlyle, crybaby, cry

Man, it's all been forgiven
Swans are a-swimming
I'll explain everything to the geeks

All the very best of us
String ourselves up for love
All the very best of us

Every house on the street
Will get on their feet
Carry the sleepers out into the weather, from the violet cities
The violet cities

They'll turn on their lights and open their eyes
Drop to their knees and they'll drink from the river in the violet cities
The violet cities

On and on they'll lead us on and
On and on they'll lead us on
We'll all get high and walk off
Into the country, ridiculous country
Where the blue sky will smother us
Believe me, believe me, believe me
The blue sky will smother us

They'll open their doors and they'll sing to the sun
We don't know anymore how to glitter we come
From the violet cities
The violet cities

If we stand there and stare and everyone's come
They may never find out that we came here at all
From the violet cities
The violet cities

On and on they'll lead us on and
On and on they'll lead us on
We'll all get high and walk off
Into the country, ridiculous country
Where the blue sky will smother us
Believe me, believe me, believe me
The blue sky will smother us
Believe me, believe me, believe me






I had a hole in the middle
Where the lightning went through
I told my friends not to worry
My wife would know how to fix it
Hole in the middle
I'm seeing less of you
Now I'm not going anywhere and I don't know what I'll do

It's easy to lose your grip
It's easy

I never tell my decisions to the one's I adore
I just show up like a Bible-breather outside the door
But when I look in the window
I see girls on TV
Living and dying in L.A. and it means nothing to me

It's easy to lose your grip
It's easy
It's easy to lose your grip
It's easy

So I walk through the streets I love
And I'm led to the house I built
And I walk through the streets I love
And I lay in your bed again

Wake up your saints Jenny, I need them
Jenny I need them, today
Wake up your saints Jenny, I need them
Jenny I need them, today

I didn't have to explain to her
That I wasn't dead
She sat me down and lit some colored candles over my head
She said you're right it's a livin'
But you're wrong for the life
Honey you never should've listened to my father's advice

It's easy to lose your grip
It's easy
It's easy to lose your grip
It's easy

So I walk through the streets I love
And I'm led to the house I built
And I walk through the streets I love
And I lay in your bed again

Wake up your saints Jenny, I need them
Jenny I need them, today
Wake up your saints Jenny, I need them
Jenny I need them, today






I was in a fog, I didn't notice everything
Was coming all apart inside of me
There wasn't any way for anyone to settle in
You made a slow disaster out of me

There's a radiant darkness upon us
But I don't want you to worry
I was careful, but nothing is harmless
Baby, you better hurry

You were a kindness when I was a stranger
But I wouldn't ask for what I didn't need
Everything's weird and we're always in danger
Why would you shatter somebody like me?

It doesn't work that way
Wanting not to want you won't make it so
It doesn't work that way
Don't leave me here alone

I'll do what I can to be a confident wreck
Can't feel this way forever, I mean
There wasn't any way for anyone to settle in
You made a slow disaster out of me

There's a radiant darkness upon us
But I don't want you to worry
I was careful, but nothing is harmless
Baby, you better hurry

You were a kindness when I was a stranger
But I wouldn't ask for what I didn't need
Everything's weird and we're always in danger
Why would you shatter somebody like me?

It doesn't work that way
Wanting not to want you won't make it so
It doesn't work that way
Don't leave me here alone






Wall Street jumps in the Hudson
with gold in their bathing suits
Then we send in the miracle fairies
That's all we do

Want to give a withering speech to the fucked
Want to give a withering speech to the fucked

We had beautiful views of the
Weather coming for us
We'll dive in with the sin-eaters
While they suck it all up

Want to give a withering speech to the fucked
Want to give a withering speech to the fucked

Save my young white neck, it ain't my fault
Save my young white neck, it ain't my fault






You had fun but you couldn't get him out of the car
I guess mama's boy's only go so far
You went in and put a record on
To make it sound like someone was home
And thanked yourself for pouring yourself a drink

You try to figure out and laugh yourself to the showers
Burn yourself alive and join the monster squad
They say in this place you can reinvent yourself

Well, you've done it again, Virginia
Made another masterpiece while I was dreaming
How does it feel to feel like you?
Brilliant sugar, brilliant sugar, brilliant sugar, turn over

A cool, tall, drink of water is all you ever wanted to be
And if you had another wish to wish you'd be fun and moving
But you can't talk to people, right? You can't tell a story
You're tall, you're long legged and your heart's full of liquor
Me and everybody are just ice in a glass

Try to figure out and laugh yourself to the showers
Burn yourself alive and join the monster squad
They say in this place you can reinvent yourself

Well, you've done it again, Virginia
Made another masterpiece while I was dreaming
How does it feel to feel like you?
Brilliant sugar, brilliant sugar, brilliant sugar, turn over

Well, you've done it again, Virginia
Made another masterpiece while I was dreaming
How does it feel to feel like you?

I don't worry anymore
Nothing like I did before
I don't worry
I just watch them rolling back
I don't worry anymore
'Cause it's all right, all right to see a ghost
And I wanna see 'em go down in the river where they go
And I wanna see 'em rolling, rolling back
And I wanna see 'em go
'Cause it's all right, all right to see your ghost

I'm gonna run to the river
Kiss my hand and wait
Gonna run to the river
Gonna throw a blue bouquet
'Cause they're gonna be cool happy genius heroes
I'm gonna miss 'em so much

I will settle in and dream
Of a slow and funny scene
I will settle in and watch 'em rolling back
I will settle in and dream
'Cause it's all right, all right to see a ghost
And I wanna see 'em go down in the river where they go
And I wanna see 'em rolling, rolling back

I'm gonna run to the river
Kiss my hand and wait
Gonna run to the river
Gonna throw a blue bouquet
'Cause they're gonna be cool happy genius heroes
I'm gonna miss them so much

I'm gonna run to the river
Kiss my hand and wait
Gonna run to the river
Gonna send 'em on their way
'Cause they're gonna be cool happy genius heroes
I'm gonna miss them so much

Yeah, they're gonna be cool happy genius heroes
I'm gonna miss 'em so much






I was home entertaining guests, when I fell off the chair and cracked open my head
Bees flew out, and they flew up their skirts
Because they wanted to travel the world

I was home entertaining guests, when I fell off the chair and cracked open my head
Bees flew out, and they flew up their skirts
Because they wanted to travel the world

But I keep it upstairs
Keep it upstairs for the grand finale
I keep it upstairs
Gonna be a blank slate
Gonna wear a white cape
But I keep it upstairs
Gonna jump out of a cake with my heart on a string
Keep it upstairs, keep it upstairs, keep it upstairs

I go out looking in parked cars
For somebody famous to kidnap and love
Beat off the army with a tennis racket

I go out looking in parked cars
For somebody famous to kidnap and love
Beat off the army with a tennis racket
That's my whole plan

But I keep it upstairs
Keep it upstairs for the grand finale
I keep it upstairs
Gonna be a blank slate
Gonna wear a white cape
But I keep it upstairs
Gonna tackle young girls off their beautiful bikes
But I keep it upstairs, keep it upstairs, keep it upstairs

I don't know what I thought I'd be by now
My head is a buzzing three star hotel
Oh no
No no no no no no no no

But I keep it upstairs

Keep your legs from shaking, fill your eyes with new tears,
Don't ask questions, you don't know your name,
Something for everyone, try to win prizes,
Stay young and quiet

Tall Saint, I'm devoted with a glass of champagne to you,
Bubbles to the chandelier,
I'm in your hands tonight, Tall Saint,
Stay behind me

Don't tell everybody at the table about your dreams,
They're too amazing, it'll melt their minds,
Take 'em to Hollywood, cut out the good parts,
Become millionaires

Tall Saint, I'm devoted with a glass of champagne to you,
Bubbles to the chandelier,
I've been looking for you all night, Tall Saint,
Stay behind me now, Tall Saint

In my city, I didn't make a sound,
When I fell over and cracked my crown,
Heard a woman say
"Stay down, Champion, stay down"

Tall Saint, I'm devoted with a glass of champagne to you,
Bubbles to the chandelier,
I'm in your hands tonight, Tall Saint,
Stay behind me now, Tall Saint,
Stay behind me now, Tall Saint

In my city, I didn't make a sound,
When I fell over and cracked my crown,
Heard a woman say
"Stay down, Champion, stay down"

But I got up, got in a car,
Said "I don't think I'm gonna go very far"
Just take me one time around the ballroom slow,
And take me home






Oh, well I just don't know
How you could go without permission
Cause well, if you're not there
Well I just don't care for this omission

Every moment brings me down when you're not around
But all I'm asking for is come back for just one day

So where did you go
And do you now know how to be happy
Cause here well it's pretty clear
When you're not near me I am unhappy

Every moment brings me down when you're not around
But all I'm asking for is come back for just one day
And make it worth the while just to see your smile
That's all I'm asking for

Oh I've come to know
You had to go without permission
Cause it was how, how I wore you down
And how I dragged you round my sole ambition

Every moment brings me down when you're not around
But all I'm asking for is come back for just one day
And make it worth the while just to see your smile
That's all I'm asking for, my dear






On my feet I stand tonight
Stand and step up to the light
An extraordinary man
Unbroken in a breaking light

Forever after days
Stand and make myself a crown
To the table I step alone
Hold my own above the ground

Take my shot under the light
Heroes come the common way
Pull myself into the sky
Wrap me in the banner I made

On my feet I stand tonight
Stand alone inside the air
An extraordinary man
Everything stops and holds me there

Forever after days
Stand and make myself a crown
To the table I step alone
And hold my own above the ground

Take my shot under the light
Heroes come the common way
Pull myself into the sky
Wrap me in the banner I made

Forever after days
Stand and make myself a crown
To the table I step alone
And hold my own above the ground

Take my shot under the light
Heroes come the common way
Pull myself into the sky
Wrap me in the banner I made






I'm keeping you in mind
For the rest of years, for the rest of years
In your watery eyes I'm gonna rest all day
In your watery eyes I'm gonna rest all day
In your watery eyes I'm gonna rest some day
In your watery eyes

Tell the saint I'm gonna be a little late
Drawing lines around the river for the rest of years
All in time, but you fade away from
All in time, but you fade away from me

They can't see what I can see
Turned away from me
I can turn everything around
I can turn everything around

They can't see what I can see
Turned away from me
I can turn everything around
I can turn everything around

I heard you in my sleep
For the rest of years, for the rest of years

So lonely, I'm trying to hear you
So lonely, I'm trying to hear you
So lonely, I'm trying to hear you
So lonely, I'm

All in time, but you fade away from
All in time, but you fade away from me love

Today you were far away
and I didn't ask you why
What could I say
I was far away
You just walked away
and I just watched you
What could I say

How close am I to losing you

Tonight you just close your eyes
and I just watch you
slip away

How close am I to losing you

Hey, are you awake
Yeah I'm right here
Well can I ask you about today

How close am I to losing you
How close am I to losing






Stay out super late tonight picking apples, making pies
Put a little something in our lemonade and take it with us
We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire

Tiptoe through our shiny city with our diamond slippers on
Do our gay ballet on ice, bluebirds on our shoulders
We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire

Turn the light out say goodnight, no thinking for a little while
Let's not try to figure out everything at once
It's hard to keep track of you falling through the sky
We're half awake in a fake empire
We're half awake in a fake empire







You have to do it running but you do everything that they ask you to
'Cause you don't mind seeing yourself in a picture
As long as you look faraway, as long as you look removed
Showered and blue-blazered, fill yourself with quarters
Showered and blue-blazered, fill yourself with quarters

You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends
When you pass them at night under the silvery, silvery citibank lights
Arm in arm in arm and eyes and eyes glazing under
Oh, you wouldn't want an angel watching over
Surprise, surprise they wouldn't wanna watch
Another uninnocent, elegant fall into the unmagnificent lives of adults

Make up something to believe in your heart of hearts
So you have something to wear on your sleeve of sleeves
So you swear you just saw a feathery woman
Carry a blindfolded man through the trees
Showered and blue-blazered, fill yourself with quarters
Showered and blue-blazered, fill yourself with quarters

You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends
When you pass them at night under the silvery, silvery citibank lights
Arm in arm in arm and eyes and eyes glazing under
Oh, you wouldn't want an angel watching over
Surprise, surprise they wouldn't wanna watch
Another uninnocent, elegant fall into the unmagnificent lives of adults

You get mistaken for strangers by your own friends
When you pass them at night under the silvery, silvery citibank lights
Arm in arm in arm and eyes and eyes glazing under

Surprise, surprise they wouldn't wanna watch
Another uninnocent, elegant fall into the unmagnificent lives of adults






I've been dragging around from the end of your coat for two weeks, oh
Everywhere you go is swirling, everything you say has water under it, oh
You know I keep your fingerprints in a pink folder in the middle of my table
You're the tall kingdom I surround
Think I better follow you around

You might need me more than you think you will
Come home in the car you love, brainy brainy brainy

I've been dragging around from the end of your coat for two weeks, oh
You keep changing your fancy, fancy mind every time I decide to let it go
I was up all night again, boning up and reading the American dictionary
You'll never believe me what I found
Think I better follow you around

You might need me more than you think you will
Come home in the car you love, brainy brainy brainy
You might need me more than you think you will
Come home in the car you love, brainy brainy brainy






Underline everything, I'm a professional in my beloved white shirt
Underline everything, I'm a professional in my beloved white shirt
I'm going down among the saints

Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor Victoria! Squalor Victoria!
Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor Victoria! Squalor Victoria!

Out of my league, I have birds in my sleeves and I wanna rush in with the fools
Out of my league, I have birds in my sleeves and I wanna rush in with the fools

Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor Victoria! Squalor Victoria!
Raise our heavenly glasses to the heavens
Squalor Victoria! Squalor Victoria!

I'm going down among the saints

3: 30 in the last night for you to save this
You're zoning out, zoning out, zoning out, zoning out
3: 30 in the last night for you to save this
You're zoning out, zoning out, zoning out, zoning out

This isn't working, you, my middlebrow fuck-up






Falling out of touch with all my
Friends are somewhere getting wasted
Hope they're staying glued together
I have arms for them

Take another sip of them
It floats around and takes me over
Like a little drop of ink
In a glass of water

Get inside their clothes with my green gloves
Watch their videos in their chairs
Get inside their beds with my green gloves
Get inside their heads, love their loves

Cinderella through the room
I glide and swan
'Cause I'm the best slow dancer
In the universe

Falling out of touch with all my
Friends are somewhere getting wasted
Hope they're staying glued together
I have arms for them

Get inside their clothes with my green gloves
Watch their videos in their chairs
Get inside their beds with my green gloves
Get inside their heads, love their loves

Now I hardly know them
And I'll take my time
I'll carry them over
And I'll make them mine

Get inside their clothes with my green gloves
Watch their videos in their chairs
Get inside their beds with my green gloves
Get inside their heads, love their loves






Standing at the punch table swallowing punch
Can't pay attention to the sound of anyone
A little more stupid, a little more scared
Every minute more unprepared

I made a mistake in my life today
Everything I love gets lost in drawers
I want to start over, I want to be winning
Way out of sync from the beginning

I wanna hurry home to you
Put on a slow, dumb show for you and crack you up
So you can put a blue ribbon on my brain
God I'm very, very frightening, I'll overdo it

Looking for somewhere to stand and stay
I leaned on the wall and the wall leaned away
Can I get a minute of not being nervous
And not thinking of my dick

My leg is sparkles, my leg is pins
I better get my shit together, better gather my shit in
You could drive a car through my head in five minutes
From one side of it to the other

I wanna hurry home to you
Put on a slow, dumb show for you and crack you up
So you can put a blue ribbon on my brain
God I'm very, very frightening, I'll overdo it

You know I dreamed about you
For 29 years before I saw you
You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for, for 29 years

You know I dreamed about you
For 29 years before I saw you
You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for, for 29 years






Be still for a second while I try
And try to pin your flowers on
La, la, la, la

Can you carry my drink I have everything else
I can tie my tie all by myself
I'm getting tied, I'm forgetting why

Oh, we're so disarming darling, everything we did believe
Is diving, diving, diving, diving off the balcony
Tired and wired we ruin too easy
Sleep in our clothes and wait for winter to leave

Hold ourselves together with our
Arms around the stereo for hours
La, la, la, la, la

While it sings to itself or whatever it does
When it sings to itself of its long lost loves
I'm getting tied, I'm forgetting why

Tired and wired we ruin too easy
Sleep in our clothes and wait for winter to leave
But I'll be with you behind the couch when they come
On a different day just like this one

We'll stay inside till somebody finds us
Do whatever the TV tells us
Stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz for days

We'll stay inside till somebody finds us
Do whatever the TV tells us
Stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz

So worry not
All things are well
We'll be alright
We have our looks and perfume

Stay inside til somebody finds us
Do whatever the TV tells us
Stay inside our rosy-minded fuzz

So worry not
All things are well
We'll be alright
We have our looks and perfume on






We expected something
Something better than before
We expected something more

Do you really think you can just put it in a safe behind a painting
Lock it up and leave?
Do you really think you can just put it in a safe behind a painting
Lock it up and leave?

Walk away now and you're gonna start a war

Whatever went away, I'll get it over now
I'll get money, I'll get funny again
Whatever went away, I'll get it over now
I'll get money, I'll get funny again

Walk away now and you're gonna start a war

We expected something
Something better than before
We expected something more

You were always weird but I never had to hold you by the edges
Like I do now
You were always weird but I never had to hold you by the edges
Like I do now

Walk away now and you're gonna start a war

Whatever went away, I'll get it over now
I'll get money, I'll get funny again
Whatever went away, I'll get it over now
I'll get money, I'll get funny again

Walk away now and you're gonna start a war
Walk away now and you're gonna start a war






They're gonna send us to prison for jerks
For having vague ideas of the way to turn each other on again
They're gonna send us to prison for jerks

They'll find us here
Here, here in the guest room
Where we throw money at each other and cry
Oh, my

We miss being ruffians, going wild and bright
In the corners of front yards, getting in and out of cars
We miss being deviants

They'll find us here
Here, here in the guest room
Where we throw money at each other and cry
Oh, my

We can't stay here
We're starting to stay the same
We can't stay here
We can't stay this way


Just tie your woman to your wrist
Give her room to tie the other

They'll find us here
Here, here in the guest room
Where we throw money at each other and cry
Oh, my






You're pink, you're young, you're middle-class
They say it doesn't matter
Fifteen blue shirts and womanly hands
You're shooting up the ladder

Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my God, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time, you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my God, it was a million years ago

Sometimes you get up and bake a cake or something
Sometimes you stay in bed
Sometimes you go, la, di, da, di, da, di, da, da
Till your eyes roll back into your head

Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my God, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time, you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my God, it was a million years ago

you're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know
You're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know

Your mind is racing like a pro now
Oh my God, it doesn't mean a lot to you
One time, you were a glowing young ruffian
Oh my God, it was a million years ago

you're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know
You're dumbstruck, baby
You're dumbstruck, baby, now you know
You're dumbstruck, baby






Ada don't talk about reasons why you don't want to talk about reasons
Why you don't wanna talk
Now that you got everybody you consider sharp
All alone, all together, all together in the dark

Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air

Ada put the sounds of your house in a song
Try to be speechless for a minute
If you think you gonna faint, go out in the hallway
Let them all have your neck

Ada don't stay in the lake too long
It lives alone and it barely knows you
It'll have a nervous breakdown and fall
Into a thousand pieces around you

Stand inside an empty tuxedo with grapes in my mouth
Waiting for Ada
Ada hold onto yourself by the sleeves
I think everything counts a little more than we think

Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air

Ada, Ada, Ada, Ada
Ada I can hear the sound of your laugh through the wall

Ada don't talk about reasons why you don't want to talk about reasons
Why you don't wanna talk
Now that you got everybody you consider sharp
All alone, all together, all together in the dark

Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air
Leave it all up in the air

Ada, Ada, Ada, Ada
Ada I can hear the sound of your laugh through the wall
Ada, Ada, Ada, Ada
Ada, I've been hoping you know your way 'round

I think this place is full of spies
I think they're onto me
Didn't anybody, didn't anybody tell you
Didn't anybody tell you how to gracefully disappear in a room
I know you put in the hours to keep me in sunglasses, I know

And so and now I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
It went the dull and wicked ordinary way
And now I'm sorry I missed you
I had a secret meeting in the basement of my brain

I think this place is full of spies
I think I'm ruined
Didn't anybody, didn't anybody tell you
Didn't anybody tell you, this river's full of lost sharks

Karen, I'm not taking sides
I don't think I'll ever do that again
I'll end up winning and I won't know why
I'm really trying to shine here, I'm really trying
You're changing clothes and closing windows on me all the time

Well, whatever you do, listen, you better wait for me
No, I wouldn't go out alone into America
Whatever you do
Listen, you better wait for me
No, I wouldn't go out alone

Karen, we should call your father, maybe it's just a phase
He'll know the trick to get a wayward soul to change his ways
It's a common fetish for a doting man
to ballerina on the coffee table cock in hand

Well, whatever you do
Listen, you better wait for me
No, I wouldn't go out alone into America
Whatever you do
Listen, you better wait for me
No, I wouldn't go out alone

Without warm water in my head
All I see is black and white and red
I feel mechanical and thin
Hear me play my violin again
I'm living in the target's shoes
All I see is black and white and blue.
Idle, idle, idle, idle, protect the nest
Protect the title

Karen, put me in a chair, fuck me and make me a drink
I've lost direction, and I'm past my peak
I'm telling you this isn't me
No, this isn't me
Karen, believe me, you just haven't seen my good side yet

Well, whatever you do
Listen. you better wait for me
No, I wouldn't go out alone into America
Whatever you do
Listen, you better wait for me
No, I wouldn't go out alone

Without warm water in my head

Hear me play my violin again
I'm living in the target's shoes
All I see is black and white and blue
Idle, idle, idle, idle, protect the nest
Protect the title

I must be me, I'm in my head
Black birds are circling my bed
I must be me, I must be me
Black feathers are falling on my feet
Idle, idle, idle, idle, protect the nest
Protect the title






My bodyguard shows her revolver to anyone who asks
And yeah, she comes to attention when you come up to me too fast
For a little while you'll be here, the only good part of me
For a little while you'll be here

So lit up, lit up, lit up, alright
I try to untie Manhattan
Lit up, lit up, lit up, alright
I try to untie

You wear your skirt like a flag
And everything surrounds you and it doesn't fade
Nothing like this sound I make that only lasts the season
And only heard by bedroom kids who buy it for that reason

'Cause you're the lowlife of the party, bad blood
Bad blood for everybody, I'm in control and I believe

So lit up, lit up, lit up, alright
I try to untie Manhattan

It's a little too late, too late, too late for this
Isn't it a little too late for this
Little too late, too late for this
Isn't it a little too late for this

You know you have a permanent piece
Of my medium-sized American heart

We're out looking for astronauts, looking for astronauts
We're out looking for astronauts, looking for astronauts
Are we gone
Come on yeah, we know we're gone
Bye bye bye
Bye bye bye we know we're gone

Take all your reasons and take them away
To the middle of nowhere, and on your way home
Throw from your window your record collection
They all run together and never make sense
But that's how we like it, and that's all we want
Something to cry for, and something to hunt

Are we gone

Of my medium-sized American heart
So don't wear the watch
When you're out with the cunts
You can break what you have, but the rest of it's mine

Take all your reasons and take them away
To the middle of nowhere, and on your way home
Throw from your window your record collection
They all run together and never make sense
But that's how we like it, and that's all we want
Something to cry for, and something to hunt






I have your good clothes in the car
So cut your hair so no one knows
I have your dreams and your teethmarks
And all my fingernails are painted

I'm here to take you now

You were right about the end
It didn't make a difference
Everything I can remember
I remember wrong

How can anybody know
How they got to be this way
You must have known
I'd do this someday

Break my arms around the one I love
And be forgiven by the time my lover comes
Break my arms around my love
Break my arms around the one I love
And be forgiven by the time my lover comes
Break my arms around my love

I don't have any questions
I don't think it's gonna rain
You were right about the end
It didn't make a difference

I'm here to take you now
Out among the missing sons and daughters of the Soho riots
Out among the missing sons and daughters of the Soho riots
I'm here to take you now

How can anybody know
How they got to be this way
You must have known
I'd do this someday

And be forgiven by the time my lover comes
Break my arms around my love
Break my arms around the one I love
And be forgiven by the time my lover comes
Break my arms around my love

Break my arms around the one I love







All night I lay on my pillow and pray
For my boss to stop me in the hallway
Lay my head on his shoulder and say
"Son, I've been hearing good things"
I wake up without warning and go flying around the house
In my sauvignon fierce, freaking out
Take a forty-five minute shower and kiss the mirror
And say, look at me
"Baby, we'll be fine
All we gotta do is be brave and be kind"
I put on an argyle sweater and put on a smile
I don't know how to do this

I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything

Baby, come over, I need entertaining
I had a stilted, pretending day
Lay me down and say something pretty
Lay me back down where I wanted to stay
Just say something perfect, something I can steal
Say, look at me
"Baby, we'll be fine
All we've gotta do is be brave and be kind"
I pull off your jeans, and you spill jack and coke in my collar
I melt like a witch and scream

I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything

I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything
I'm so sorry for everything

Build a fire for Val Jester
Build a room for your love
Take your time when you tell her
How she lives in your blood

You should've looked after her better
You should've looked after her more
You should've locked the door

Fill her coat with weapons and help her get it on
Cuz one day when she goes, she's gone

You should've held on to her better
You should've held on to her more
You should've locked the door

I'm put together beautifully
Big wet bottle in my fist, big wet rose in my teeth
I'm perfect piece of ass
Like every Californian
So tall I take over the street, with highbeams shining on my back
A wingspan unbelievable
I'm a festival, I'm a parade

And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me

I'm a birthday candle in a circle of black girls
God is on my side
Cuz I'm the child bride
I'm so sorry but the motorcade will have to go around me this time
Cuz God is on my side
And I'm the child bride

And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me
And all the wine is all for me

I carry the dollhouse, safe on my shoulders
Through the black city, night lights are on in the corners
And everyone's sleeping upstairs
All safe and sound
All safe and sound, I won't let the psychos around
All safe and sound, I won't let the psychos around

I'm in a state, I'm in a state
Nothing can touch us my love
I'm in a state, I'm in a state
Nothing can touch us my love

Well, tell me what am I supposed to do with that
I'm missing something
Yeah, I'm missing something
My mind's gone loose inside its shell

We'll take ourselves out in the street
And wear the blood in our cheeks
Like red roses
We'll go from car to sleeping car
And whisper in their sleeping ears
We were here, we were here
We'll set off the geese of Beverly Road

Hey, love, we'll get away with it
We'll run like we're awesome, totally genius
Hey, love, we'll get away with it

I swear we didn't have any

Hey, love, we'll get away with it
We'll run like we're awesome, totally genius
Hey, love, we'll get away with it

Put the pervert in a suit, take him out and light him up
Get him out of your system, and warm your brand new bones
Sweep him in a shopping bag, call a car and take him slow through NoLIta, driver surprise me

Any rose red whore, with impeccable taste
We'll take the place over, and let him go

Driver surprise me. Whatever works for you
I'm brand new and reinvented. Without a scratch, daisy fresh and arrow straight

That's a beautiful name. Can I take it because I don't remember anyone? And nothing reminds me

I'm a brand new house, red girl swings somewhere else
Driver surprise me
Any rose red whore, with impeccable taste. We'll take the place over, let him go
We'll let him blow in the eyes, we'll let him float in the drinks of the beautiful boys and the beautiful girls

I'll find her jewelry in my room, I'll find her voice in my mouth

You're cussing a storm in a cocktail dress your mother wore when she was young
Red sun saint around your neck
A wet martini in a paper cup
You're a wasp nest, you're a wasp nest.

Your eyes are broken bottles
And I'm afraid to ask
And all your wrath and cutting beauty
You're poison in the pretty glass
You're a wasp nest, you're a wasp nest

You're all humming live wires under your killing clothes.
Get over here, I wanna kiss your skinny throat
You're a wasp nest, you're a wasp nest





I think I saw you riding in a car
You looked happy for a woman
Black fingers in your mouth and a white
And a white pearl choker

My head plays it over and over
Don't interupt me
I think I saw you reaching for a glass
With your lanky white arms
Nothing else moves that way, are you kidding me?
My head plays it over and over
Don't interupt me

All dolled-up in straps, all colored in
Now, love, where have you been?
Dolled-up in staps, all colored in
Now, love, where have you been?
Where have you been?

I think I saw you walking in the city
Hips like boy's
The sun fell behind you and never stood up
My head plays it over and over
I think I heard you singing
'Oh poor sky, don't cry on me
Did somebody break your heart again?
Oh poor sky, don't cry on me
Are you gonna fall apart again?'
My head plays it over and over

All dolled-up in straps, all colored in
Now, love, where have you been?
Dolled-up in staps, all colored in
Now, love, where have you been?
Where have you been?

Oh poor sky, don't cry on me
Did somebody break your heart again?
Oh poor sky, don't cry on me
Did somebody break your heart again?
Oh poor sky, don't cry on me
Are you gonna fall apart again?
Oh poor sky, don't cry on me
Are you gonna fall apart again?

I don't mind losing a girl to herself
A quiet love is better than none
And I don't mind losing a friend to a friend
If only to be a reasonable man

And I don't mind waiting if it's for the best
A careful heart is better than none
I don't mind painting my back with the past
Pictures in resolute pain smoothing the laugh o'er the lane

But if it happens to you
The same kind of deal
I recommend fire
Instead of the fool

I don't mind shaking your hand at the door
If only to be a resolute man
If only to be a resolute man
If only to be a resolute man

But if it happens to you
The same kind of deal
I recommend fire
Instead of the fool

I don't mind shaking your hand at the door (pictures in resolute pain)
If only to be a resolute man (pictures in resolute pain)
If only to be a resolute man
If only to be a resolute man
If only to be a reasonable man
If only to be a reasonable man





never look her in the eyes
never tell the truth
if she knows your paper
you know she'll have to burn you

never tell the one you want that you do
save it for the deathbed
when you know you kept her wanting you

and do everything she'd never do

fall asleep with stranger's wives
the wild wives of unknown men
good for you, you've just become
just another one of them

never say you miss her
never say a word

and do everything she'd never do

don't let her see your cardinal eyes
don't let her see your cardinal eyes

let her treat you like a criminal
so you can treat her like a priest
girls forgive my human mind
girls forgive me one more time

never tell the one you love that you do
save it for the deathbed

and do everything she'd never do

don't let her see your cardinal eyes
don't let her see your cardinal eyes

jesus christ you have confused me
cornered, wasted, blessed and used me
forgive me girls i am confused
stiff and pissed and lost and loose

jesus christ you have confused me
cornered, wasted, blessed and used me
forgive me girls i am confused
stiff and pissed and lost and loose





sit down dear we gotta talk
your acting like a kid
we don't wanna hear about
the things you never did

you coulda been a legend
but you became a father
that's what you are today
that's what you are today

spending all your time
somewhere inside your head
haunted by the important
life you coulda lead

but your kisses aren't enough
to keep your kids in line
so you better straighten out yourself
and give your baby time
cause if you don't give her what she needs
she'll get it where she can
she's lonely man

Don't leave yourself alone for too many days
Sooner than you know your gonna start slipping

you'll end up talking to the ghost
of your wife as if you knew her
your eyes will put her everywhere

and spending all your time
somewhere inside your head
haunted by the important
life you coulda lead

you'll fuck yourself to clear your head
you'll close your door and go to bed
you'll try to sleep without a dream
that's where she finds you
that's where she finds you

Don't leave yourself alone for too many days
Sooner than you know your gonna start slipping

Dear we better get a drink in you
before you start to bore us
Dear we better get a drink in you
before you start to bore us
Dear we better get a drink in you
before you start to bore us

"Don't forget the alcohol oooh baby oooh baby"





Well I know that you know
that you've become the target of this hand
with never even asking
Well I know that you know
that you're the only thing that I can stand

so how could your hair
have the nerve to dance around like that, blowing
and how could the air
have the nerve to blow your hair around like that

I'm waiting for a 90-mile water wall
to take me out of your view
I'm looking for a trap door trigger
to drop me out of your view

Yes I'm listening I'm listening
I can tell that you are serious
Your looking for that hurt look around my mouth
the look of a steep fall
yeah that's how Hersey put it

so you can make another claim
well go ahead and make it
so you can make another claim
well go ahead and make it

I'm just waiting for a 90-mile water wall
to take me out of your view
I'm praying for a trap door trigger

I'm just waiting for a 90-mile water wall
to take me out of your view
I'm praying for a trap door trigger

Yes I'm listening
I can tell you're serious





We look younger than we feel
and older than we are
now nobody's funny
no god, they took our fashion week
that's a real bad thing
cause we have scars to cover

now I forget how to think
so crack my skull
rearrange me

lover put me in your beautiful bed
and cover me
lover put me in your beautiful bed

Nothing made a sound in Williamstown that night
and all the air was empty
then what to my wondering eyes should appear
nothing, cause nothing ever happens here

now I forget how to think
so crack my skull
rearrange me

lover put me in your beautiful bed
and cover me
lover put me in your beautiful bed

nothing ever happened here
nothing ever happened here
bad things never happen to the beautiful





As far as I can tell
I'm nothing like a princess
but today I find myself
curling up behind the house

There's nothing in the air today
now I know I'm not so important

Take these girly arms
and ever keep me
Take these girly arms
and ever keep me

I don't have a hawk in my heart
no dumbass dove in my brain
I don't have a hawk in my heart
no dumbass dove in my dumbass brain

Take these girly arms
and ever keep me
Take these girly arms
and ever keep me

I don't have a hawk in my heart
no I don't have a hawk in my heart
no I don't have a hawk in...





Did you clean yourself
for me last night
put the water out and donned a marigold
in your hair to bring me here
and tie one on you

did you dress me down and liquor me up
to make me last for the minute
when the red comes over you
like it does when you're filled with love
or whatever you call it

do you feel alone when I'm in my head
while you wait for me
to take my breath
do you still feel clean
when the only dirt is the dirt I left
how can you blame yourself
when I did everything I wanted to

you just made yourself available
you just made yourself available

why did you dress me down
and lick me up






Sugar wife, sugar wife
Sugar wife, can you make me a man?
Baby doll, can you make me a dad?

I'm no butterfly, I'm no butterfly
I'm no butterfly, I'm no butterfly

If you tried to make a miracle
You never shoulda tried
If you tried to make a miracle

Sugar wife
Baby doll

Can you make me a man?
Can you make me a dad?
Can you make me a man?
Can you make me a dad?

Sugar wife






no nobody wants to be
no no one's lover
no matter what they say
lovers know they are the ones
who one day have to go

trophy wives
I know they wander
and find a young young man
trophy wives
I know they wander

one time you were a good rabbit
to all the girls
and all their lovely mothers
you tried a piece of everything
now nothing turns you on

trophy wives
I know they wander
and find a young young man
trophy wives
I know they wander

run run baby I don't feel alive
but I'm pretty and I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna be alright to drive
to new jack city for a younger man
with a better brain

I fell in love with you
no matter what you say
but you were right about the reasons
I don't want to be
what I'm becoming

your trophy wife
I know they wander
and find a young young man
you trophy wife
I know they wander
and find a young man
your trophy wife
I know they wander






In a fashion coat I, I float down my city
Don't you think I look pretty anymore
I'll do everything to you, but I can hardly come
'Cause I'm so afraid of you, falling

I die fast in this city
Outside I die slow

I'm not stupid, I swear
I read the foreign news to understand my nation
You get two options in the You Estates
Black city bloodbath or white country rape

I die fast in this city
Outside I die slow
I die fast in this city
Outside I die slow

Everywhere I am is
Just another thing
Without you in it
Oh, everywhere I am is
Just another thing
Without you in it
Yeah, everywhere I am is
Just another thing
Without you in it
Yeah, everywhere I am is
Just another thing
Without you in it






tonight there isn't any light under your door
I guess you must be somewhere breathing
where skin and everything still know what they are for
and blood remembers where to go

I fell in love with you no matter what you say
but you were right about the reasons
to turn a magdeline into the month of May
I shoulda known the magdeline was me

so I'm turning on the stereo
and I'm lining up the names
on the mixes I made before you
and I'm turning into fairytales
with glitter and some glue
everything we ever planned to ever do

tonight there isn't any light under your door
I guess you must be somewhere breathing
in patterns unfamiliar to the one you're underneath
I pinned those patterns in my coat

so I'm turning on the stereo
and I'm turning into fairytales
yes I'm turning on the stereo
and I'm turning into you






Every time you get a drink
And every time you go to sleep
All those dreams inside your head
Is there sunlight on your bed?

And every time you're driving home
Way outside your safety zone
Wherever you will ever be
You're never getting rid of me

You own me
There's nothing you can do
You own me

You coulda made a safer bet
But what you break is what you get
You wake up in the bed you make
I think you made a big mistake

You own me
There's nothing you can do
You own me
You own me
Lucky you

You own me
There's nothing you can do

You clean yourself to meet
The man who isn't me
You're putting on a shirt
A shirt I'll never see
The letter's in your coat
But no one's in your head
Cause you're too smart to remember
You're too smart

Lucky you
Lucky you
Lucky you






You're walking taller than you should
The air is thin around your beautiful head
You're saying things with your mouth to me
That I don't recognize
You're aware of yourself lately

Redefining yourself
Designing yourself
You haven't looked at me forever
Got a diagram of your associations
A strategy
You're weighing your options

What would you trade me for?
You're measuring me lately
And I can tell
And I can tell I'm losing weight
You're measuring me lately
You're dressing me

Do not tell me I've changed
You're just raising your standards
Do not give me away
I am the same
I am the same

Have you found him?
Have you told him everything?
Does he say he feels bad about all this?
You've shown tenderness for me
Tenderness for me
To him

Do not tell me I've changed
You're just raising your standards
Do not give me away
I am the same
I am the same






Bottle eyes, glassy blue
I watch the rain come out of you
Sky is white with the flu
I'm terrified of losing you
If I go to the sea, I'll bring you down, down with me
If I go to the rain, you'll never see me again

You've got cold girl fever

I promised to leave if you ever went cold
Then leave when I'm sleeping, you told me
Put your spine in your back and your arms in your coat
Don't hold on to me when there's nothing to hold

You've got cold girl fever

It's not what you said, but that's what you meant
I'm losing my baby on promises kept
What are you for?
What are you for, now that I have hardcore

You've got cold girl fever






Ten years older than I was
When I brought you down to see
What I thought would make you fall in love

Wearing off on our dreams
Someday man I'm gonna be no different than the other rivers
I tried to look at you but I couldnt break the ice
You stood out there for an hour freezing
Put your hand around my back
I guess you thought I needed that

I never try to find you
I hope you don't remember me
I hope you're not alone

Wanted me to take you home
You said you'd rather be alone
I never thought of that
Car is warm and we had wine
But I couldn't find the perfect song

Now our furniture for the one with crows feet and I can't even remember the call
Sometimes I can feel your weight when I close my eyes
Seven times I was under you

I never try to find you
I hope you dont remember me
I hope your not alone
I don't wanna know what your thinking
I'm looking out the window
Just fucking drinking
Shallow frame and shaky sticks but I know there's a river in me
Shallow minded adult tricks but I know there's a river in me







give my jewels to the army, my silverware and jeans
give my love to your family; tell them anything
give yourself to anyone; give yourself away
don't be a nightingale for anyone's space to fill
if i could, i'd be your star again
fall across your falling sky

it takes a lot of little rain to make you feel like nothing
anything, anything you can do, do to me for everything i did for you
nothing
i didn't try to take your love away
i just never knew i had it

there is nothing you can say to ever make me want you
american
there is nothing you can say to ever make me leave you
american

american mary

if you kiss me, kiss me with your silver eyes
don't look at me like someone you don't recognize
i didn't try to do this
your arms around my shoulderblades
are useless

there is nothing you can say to ever make me want you
american
there is nothing you can say to ever make me leave you
american

american mary






And if you follow me son
The window wrap around you
Carry from the ground
You will never be alone

You wait one turn to sunlight
That's falling on a girl
You're still outside the world

She's reading books from empty women
They're givin beauty tips from empty hips

And how is the water of the rain
And how is the air of the wind
And how are the arms of your mother
She's holding you in

Watch them as they try to fly their kites inside their bedrooms
That were only built for drinking
Your thoughts they never lasted long when you were under the sky
Above it you can hold a thought forever

And how is the water of the rain
And how is the air of the wind
And how are the arms of your mother
She's holding you in
And how is the water of the rain
And how is the air of the wind
And how are the arms of your mother
She's holding you in






I thought I'd come to you
And your long lazy scene
Instate direction, finger on a magazine
I'd call you when I need you
I can't get used to your new name

Send a body double over with your keys
She'll see you in an hour
Everybody quiet please
Essex house is down the road
The actors want to be alone

Your room is still and soft
As a jeweler's
Incidental music coming down the hall
Remember when I never had to wait for you at all?
I wish my hands were yours as I lay your keys
On a magazine

Take me to LaGuardia
My baby's gonna pay for me

Bottle from the duty-free
I'll drink it all across the sea
Lay me down business class
Headphones and a sleeping mask

She's gonna pay for me
She's gonna pay for me

Brother, I wish you were home
Just tell me you're not alone
Call me back; I'm on a plane
I think I'm somewhere over spain
I'm in the dark without the stars
I've never seen a black suit dark
Thought I'd be above the rain
Somewhere on a higher plane

Oh brother, I wish you were home
My brother, I wish you were home

Baby, you're asleep by now
You never stayed awake for me
You never waited up for me,
No, you never waited up for me!
Now there's nothing I can do
I lost you but i beat the sound
Couldn't if I wanted to
The cogwheel doesn't turn around!

Oh brother, I wish you were home
My baby is in a room alone

My brother, I wish you were home






Sweetie, you don't look so good
Your bottom lip is bleeding
I cut it on your collarbone
Go on, go back to sleep

Sugar, who were you thinking of?
You woke me with your breathing
Honey, how am I supposed to tell?

If I were a spy in the world inside your head
Would I be your wife in a better life you led?

Thought I saw you on the stairs
Of this american century
I went up through all the years
You were years ahead of me
Remember when you dipped your hand?
I never saw it coming
You took the wind out of me

If i were a spy in the world inside your head
Would I be your wife in the better life you led?

I'd do you better than you do
I'd do you better than you ever will
When I am on bitters and absolut

If I were a spy in the world inside your head
Would I be your wife in a better life you led?

I'd do you better than you do
I'd do you better than you ever will

When I am on bitters and absolut






I wanted to show you John's star
And lay down with you in strawberry fields
You said, "you're gonna lay down here
You're gonna lay down alone"
I thought I told you I was ruined by the stones

I don't ever want you to come home again
I don't want to hear your call, your voice in my room
I am divine; my arms are stronger than rivers
And when you feel that way, you want to feel that way again
Forever

Once ruined, baby you stay ruined
Yeah, once ruined, baby you stay ruined

Anything is beautiful and I blame you
I woke up in your sheets of rain
And everything you touch around here,
You leave a stain

Once ruined, baby you stay ruined
Yeah, once ruined, baby you stay ruined






You stand now, on yourself
A little moon is coming in the room
You stand there still
Like you were in the arms of everyone you ever wanted

I was watching you well

I won't stop you; I won't speak
The water on your cheek is the only thing smooth and
I'm ashamed that I'm ashamed of you
Standing in my room, lest more water overtake you

And I was watching you, watching you well

Why won't you leave me quicker
Why won't you leave me?

I'm ashamed that I'm ashamed of you
For standing in my room, lest more water overtake you

I won't stop you
And I won't speak

Why won't you leave me quicker?

Why won't you leave me






Where crybabies cry
in the united states
bright white on both sides
like a plate
nobody listens
nobody should
it'd be a waste of attention

not enough money
to buy a PC
so i come in this weekend
asleep on my feet
and if i forget you
ill have nobody left to forget
i guess thats what assholes get

traded my day light
for a career

but i need you to disprove
my theory of the crows

pouring my fingers across the keys
will someone review my salary please?
im selling my time to the man who sells style
that time should be mine to waste on you

ill suck off investors
ill suck off VCs

im losing my posture from time on my knees
they treat me so well
cause i'll do anything
its in my nature of service

but ill need you to disprove
my theory of the crows

kids of the wealthy are raised by the poor
you send daughters to los angelos and new york
i need mine to see me
when i wake up
i need mine to know
that im what they come to

when they come home






Could you tell the enchantment I said goodbye
I met a girl named disillusionment
Could you tell her I made the headlines
This boy drawed wings on everything

Could you tell her to check the headlines
This boy burns angels in the river
You know I dreamed about you
For 29 years before
I saw you

You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for 29 years
Bird that flys out of order
Underneath the sky

I run up to the rainbow, girl
Just to pass it by
I'll never have a change of heart
I swore I'd never sing

I have no heart this one is gone
And now I wear the wings
You know I dreamed about you
For 29 years before
I saw you

You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for 29 years
You know I dreamed about you
For 29 years before
I saw you
You know I dreamed about you
I missed you for 29 years
You know I dreamed about you
For 29 years before
I saw you






Everyone is watching
but nobody is watching for you
I don't wanna turn it on
it only makes me sad for you
I know you can play piano
that was just a talent show
I've never known you like I know you
I never wanted you to go

You're on the rocks in a two-piece suit
the dead location of the dying suit
you gave Lawrence a big salute
Texas brought them to their knees
Indiana pushes you on the stairs
your independent declaration sounded too much like a prayer

But I'll wake up and wait there for you
I'll wait there for you

Anna Freud
no confidence in Anna
Anna Freud

Remember what they said to you
Everyone will know us now
we love you babe, you make us proud
don't come home without he crowd
don't come back to long this town
we always knew you'd let us down
don't come back without the crown

Anna Freud
no confidence in Anna
Anna Freud

But I'll wake up and wait there for you
I'll wait there for you
