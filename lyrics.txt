Don't make me read your mind 
You should know me better than that 
It takes me too much time 
You should know me better than that 
You're not that much like me 
You should know me better than that 
We have different enemies 
You should know me better than that 
I should leave it alone but you're not right 
I should leave it alone but you're not right 

Can't you write it on a wall 
You should know me better than that 
There's no room to write it all 
You should know me better than that 
Can you turn the TV down 
You should know me better than that 
There's too much crying in the sound 
I should know you better than that 
I should leave it alone but you're not right 
I should leave it alone but you're not right 

I should live in salt for leaving you behind 
Behind 

Think about something so much 
You should know me better than that 
Start to slide out of touch 
You should know me better than that 
Tell yourself your it's all you know 
You should know me better than that 
Learn to appreciate the void 
You should know me better than that 

I should live in salt for leaving you behind 
Behind 
I should live in salt for leaving you behind 
Behind 

I should live in salt for leaving you behind 
Behind






When I think of you in the city,
The sight of you among the sites.
I get this sudden sinking feeling,
Of a man about to fly.
Never kept me up before,
Now I’ve been awake for days.
I can’t fight it anymore,
I’m going through an awkward phase.
I am secretly in love with,
Everyone that I grew up with.
Do my crying underwater,
I can’t get down any farther.
All my drowning friends can see,
Now there is no running from it.
It’s become the crux of me,
I wish that I could rise above it.

But I stay down,
With my demons.
But I stay down,
With my demons

Passing buzzards in the sky,
Alligators in the sewers.
I don’t even wonder why,
Hide among the under views.
Huddle with them all night long,
The worried talk to god goes on.
I sincerely tried to love it,
Wish that I could rise above it.

But I stay down,
With my demons.
I stay down,
With my demons
I stay down,
With my demons.
I stay down,
With my demons
I stay down,
With my demons

Can I stay here? I can sleep
on the floor
paint the blood and hang the palms,
On the door.
Do not think I’m going places anymore,
Wanna see the sun come up above New York.
Oh, everyday I start so great,
Then the sunlight dips.
Less I’ve learned,
The more I see the pythons and the limbs.
Do not know what’s wrong with me,
Sours in the cup.
When I walk into a room,
I do not light it up.
Fuck.

So I stay down,
With my demons
I stay down,
With my demons
I stay down,
With my demons
I stay down,
With my demons






Gold light breaks behind the houses
I don't see what's strange about this
Tiny bubbles hang above me
It's a sign that someone loves me

I can hardly stand up right
I hit my head upon the light
I have faith but don't believe it
It's not there enough to leave it

Everything I love is on the table
Everything I love is out to sea

I have only two emotions
Careful fear and dead devotion
I can't get the balance right
With all my marbles in the fight

I see all the ones I went for
All the things I had it in for
I won't cry until I hear
Cause I was not supposed to be here

Everything I love is on the table
Everything I love is out to sea
I'm not alone
I'll never be
And to the bone
I'm evergreen

I'm tired I'm freezing I'm dumb
When it gets so late I forget everyone
I need somewhere to stay
Don't think anybody I know is awake

Calm down, it's alright
Keep my arms the rest of the night
When they ask what do I see
I say a bright white beautiful heaven hanging over me

I'm not alone
I'll never be
And to the bone
I'm evergreen
And if you want (dead seriously)
To see me cry (don't swallow the cap)
Play Let It Be (pat yourself on the back)
Or Nevermind (dead seriously)

Is it time to leave? Is it time to think about
What I want to say to the girls at the door?
I need somewhere to be
But I can't get around the river in front of me

Calm down, it's alright
Leave my arms the rest of the night
When they ask what do I see
I say a bright white beautiful heaven hanging over me

I'm not alone (dead seriously)
I'll never be (don't swallow the cap)
And to the bone (pat yourself on the back)
I'm evergreen (dead seriously)
And if you want (dead seriously)
To see me cry (don't swallow the cap)
Play Let It Be (pat yourself on the back)
Or Nevermind (dead seriously)






You keep a lot of secrets
And I keep none
Wish I could go back
And keep some

You're fireproof
Nothing breaks your heart
You're fireproof
It's just the way you are

You tell me you're waiting
To find someone
Who isn't so hopeless
There's no one

You're fireproof
Nothing breaks your heart
You're fireproof
How'd you get so far?

You're a needle in the hay
You're the water at the door
You're a million miles away
It doesn't matter anymore

Jennifer, you are not the only reason
My head is boiling and my hands are freezing
Jennifer, you are not the only one
To sit awake until the wild feelings leave you

You're fireproof
Nothing breaks your heart
You're fireproof
It's just the way you are

You're fireproof
It's what you always say
You're fireproof
Wish I was that way






Oh you say you love me, Joe
How am I supposed to know?
When you go under the waves
What am I supposed to say?

I see people on the floor
They slide into the sea
Can't stay here anymore
We're turning into fiends

If I stay here
Trouble will find me
If I stay here
I'll never leave

If I stay here
Trouble will find me
I believe

Joe, I'll always think of you
As the kind of child who knew
This was never gonna last
Joe, you fell so fast

Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you but
They say love is a virtue, don't they?
Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you but
They say love is a virtue, don't they?

Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you but
They say love is a virtue, don't they?
Hey Joe, sorry I hurt you but
They say love is a virtue, don't they?

I see people on the floor
They slide into the sea
Can't stay here anymore
We're turning into fiends

I see you rushing down
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing down
What did Harvard teach you?

I see you rushing down
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing down
What did Harvard teach you?

I see you rushing down [(don't drag me in)]
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing down [(don't drag me in)]
What did Harvard teach you?

I see you rushing down [(don't drag me in)]
Tell me how to reach you
I see you rushing down [(don't drag me in)]
What did Harvard teach you?






I could walk out, but I won't
In my mind I am in your arms
I wish someone'd take my place
Can't face heaven all heavenfaced

No one's careful all the time
If you lose me I'm gonna die

How completely high was I?
I was off by a thousand miles
Hit the ceiling, then you fall
Things are tougher than we are

I could walk out, but I won't
In my mind I am in your arms
I wish someone'd take my place
Can't face heaven all heavenfaced

Let's go wait out in the fields with the ones we love
Let's go wait out in the fields with the ones we love
Let's go wait out in the fields with the ones we love
Let's go wait out in the fields with the ones we love

She's a griever, I believe her
It's not a fever, it's a freezer
I believe her, I'm a griever now

She's a griever, I believe her
It's not a fever, it's a freezer
I believe her, I'm a griever now

Because we’ll all arrive
In heaven alive
We’ll all arrive
Because we’ll all arrive
In heaven alive
We’ll all arrive






Oh, when I lift you up you feel
Like a hundred times yourself
I wish everybody knew
What's so great about you
Oh, but your love is such a swamp
You don't think before you jump
And I said I wouldn't get sucked in
Ah
Oh, don't tell anyone I'm here
I got Tylenol and beer
I was thinking that you'd call
Somebody closer to you
Oh, but your love is such a swamp
You're the only thing I want
And I said I wouldn't cry about it
Ah
We were so under the brine
We were so vacant and kind
We were so under the brine
We were so vacant
We were so under the brine
We were so vacant and kind
We were so under the brine
We were so vacant
Oh, when I lift you up you feel
Like a hundred times yourself
I wish everybody knew
What's so great about you
Oh, but your love is such a swamp
You don't think before you jump
And I said I wouldn't get sucked in
Ah
I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waiting anymore
I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waiting anymore
I won't be vacant anymore
I won't be waiting anymore
Jenny I am in trouble
Can't get these thoughts out of me
Jenny I'm seeing double
I know this changes everything
Jenny I am in trouble
Can't get these thoughts out of me
Jenny I'm seeing double
(It takes a lot of rain in the cup)
I know this changes everything
(It takes a lot of pain to pick me up)
(It takes a lot of rain in the cup)
(It takes a lot of pain to pick me up)
Baby you gave me bad ideas
Baby you left me sad and high






No one will answer your prayers
Until you take off that dress
No one will hear all your crying
Until you take your last breath

But you will learn
To mind me
And you will learn
To survive me

No one will answer your prayers
Until you take off that dress
No one will hear all your crying
Until you take your last breath

But you will learn
To mind me
And you will learn
To survive me

Your father before you
And your sister too
Your husband and blah blah blah blah
You






Graceless
Is there a powder to erase this?
Is it dissolvable and tasteless?
You can't imagine how I hate this
Graceless

I'm trying, but I'm graceless
I don't have the sunny side to face this
I am invisible and weightless
You can't imagine how I hate this
Graceless

I'm trying, but I'm gone
Through the glass again
Just come and find me
God loves everybody

Don't remind me
I took the medicine and I went missing
Just let me hear your voice
Just let me listen

Graceless
I figured out how to be faithless
But it would be a shame to waste this
You can't imagine how I hate this
Graceless

I'm trying, but I'm gone
Through the glass again
Just come and find me
God loves everybody

Don't remind me
I took the medicine and I went missing
Just let me hear your voice
Just let me listen

All of my thoughts of you
Bullets through rotten fruit
Come apart at the seams
Now I know what dying means

I am not my rosy self
Left my roses on my shelf
Take the white ones they're my favorites
It's the side effects that save us
Grace

Put the flowers you find in a vase
If you're dead in the mind it'll brighten the place
Don't let 'em die on the vine, it's a waste
Grace

There's a science to walking through windows
There's a science to walking through windows
There's a science to walking through windows
There's a science to walking through windows without you

All of my thoughts of you
Bullets through rotten fruit
Come apart at the seams
Now I know what dying means

I am not my rosy self
Left my roses on my shelf
Take the white ones they're my favorites
It's the side effects that save us
Grace

Put the flowers you find in a vase
If you're dead in the mind it'll brighten the place
Don't let them die on the vine, it's a waste
Grace

Grace
Put the flowers you find in a vase
If you're dead in the mind it'll brighten the place
Don't let them die on the vine, it's a waste
Grace






I'm in the city you hated
My eyes are falling
Counting the clicks with the living dead
My eyes are red

I'm in the crush and I hate it
My eyes are falling
I'm having trouble inside my skin
I try to keep my skeletons in

Is it weird to be back in the south?
And can they even tell
That the city girl was ever there
Or anywhere

I'm having trouble inside my skin
I try to keep my skeletons in
I'll be your friend
And a f*ck up and everything,
But I'll never be
Anything you ever want me to be.

I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts out
I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts out

I don't need any help to be breakable, believe me
I know nobody else who can laugh along to any kind of joke
I won't need any help to be lonely when you leave me

It'll be easy to cover
Gather my skeletons far inside
It'll be summer in Dallas
Before I realize

I don't want you to grieve
But I want you to sympathize (alright)
I can't blame you for losing
Your mind for a little while (so did I)
I don't want you to change
But I want you to recognize (that I)

It'll be easy to cover
Gather your skeletons far inside
It'll be summer in Dallas
Before you realize
That I'll never be
Anything you ever want me to be

I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts out
I keep coming back here where everything slipped
But I will not spill my guts out






I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I need my girl

Remember when you lost your shit and
Drove the car into the garden
And you got out and said I'm sorry
To the vines and no one saw it
I need my girl
I need my girl

I'm under the gun again
I know I was the 45 percenter then
I know I was a lot of things
But I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I need my girl
I need my girl

There's some things that I should never
Laugh about in front of family
I'll try to call you from the party
It's full of punks and cannonballers
I need my girl
I need my girl

I'm under the gun again
I know I was the 45% percenter then
I know I was a lot of things
But I am good, I am grounded
Davy says that I look taller
I can't get my head around it
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I keep feeling smaller and smaller
I keep feeling smaller and smaller






I survived the dinner
And the air went thinner
I retired to the briars by the pool
It gets so loud

If I die this instant
Taken from a distance
They would probably list it down
Among other things 'round town

Got my rings around me
I got baby to pound me
I see stars and go weak
My baby cries and lays me down

In the skies over black Venice
I see eyes of a white menace
The surprise of the week
Is that I never heard the sound

All the L.A. women
Fall asleep while swimmin'
I got paid to fish 'em out
And then one day I lost the job

And I cried a little
I got fried a little
Then she laid her eyes on mine
And she said, "Babe, you're better off"

I got my rings around me
I got baby to pound me
I see stars and go weak
My baby cries and lays me down

In the skies over black Venice
I see eyes of a white menace
The surprise of the week
Is that I never heard the sound

Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave my little life today

As the free-fall advances
I'm the moron who dances
Ah
I was teething on roses
I was in guns and noses
Ah

Under the withering white skies of humiliation
Under the withering white skies of humiliation

Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave a little life today
Tunnel vision lights my way
Leave a little life today

She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it
She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it
She wore blue velvet
Said she can't help it






I couldn't find quiet
I went out in the rain
I was just soakin' my head to unrattle my brain
Somebody said you disappeared in a crowd
I didn't understand then
I don't understand now

Am I the one you think about 
When you're sitting in your faintin' chair drinking Pink Rabbits?
Am I the one you think about 
When you're sitting in your faintin' chair drinking Pink Rabbits?

And everybody was gone 
You were staring down the street 'cause you were tryin' not to crack up
It wasn't like a rain, it was more like a sea
I didn't ask for this pain, it just came over me
I love a storm, but I don't love lightning
All the waters coming up so fast, it's frightening

Am I the one you think about 
When you're Sitting in your faintin' chair drinking Pink Rabbits?
Am I the one you think about 
When you're sitting in your faintin' chair drinking Pink Rabbits?

And everybody was gone
I was staring down the street 'cause I was trying not to crack

I was solid gold
I was in the fight
I was coming back 
From what seemed like a ruin
I couldn't see 
You coming so far
I just turn around 
And there you are

I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
I was just getting used to living life without you around
I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
You always said I held you way too high off the ground

You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in the park
You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart
You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in a park
You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart

And everybody was gone
You were staring down the street cause you were trying not to crack up
Bona Drag was still on
Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sound kicks out
Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sound kicks out

You said it would be painless
A needle in the dark
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all
You said it would be painless
A needle in the dark
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all (when the sound kicks out)

You said it would be painless
The needle in the dark (when the sound kicks out)
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all






I can see the glowing lights
I can see them every night
Really not that far away
I could be there in a day

I wonder if you live there still
I kinda think you always will
If I tried you'd probably be
Hard to find

What I feel now about you then
I'm just glad I can't explain
You're beautiful and close and young
In those ways we were the same

There's a lot I've not forgotten
I let go of other things
If I tried they'd probably be
Hard to find

They can all
Just kiss off into the air
They can all
Just kiss off into the air

I don't know why we had to lose
The ones who took so little space
We're still waiting for the ease
To cover what we can't erase

I'm not holding out for you
I'm still watching for the signs
If I tried you'd probably be
Hard to find

They can all
Just kiss off into the air
They can all
Just kiss off into the air
